Gist of what to do:

1) get pyinstaller 
2) using the commands on step 4 pyinstaller all the files together
3) go to the dist folder and have fun!




or if you cant read my mind....




----- Getting pyinstaller -----
First, if you don't have pip, pythons module installer, download it here: - https://www.python.org/downloads/

-----
On windows, pip is well, "pip", on mac and other os (i think), its called "pip3", this applies to the next step!
-----
run `pip/pip3 install pyinstaller` in your console [command prompt for windows, idk for other os....]







-----  Steps: (after getting pyinstaller)  -----

1) make sure to have all of these audios in an unzipped folder called YSKYSN

2) make sure this YSKYSN folder is in the same directory as the YSKYSNsolo.py file

3) after opening command prompt (or the equivalent in other os) navigate to the directory of these files

	to go to other directories, use the 'cd' command 

	example: 
		command prompt starts on C:\Windows\System32> 
		cd / will take it back to just C:\>
		then do something like 'cd "C:\Users\Muffinlavania\Downloads"', since my files were in the downloads folder


4) after making sure your command prompt is in the right directory run one of these commands (they are also at the start of the py file!!!):
	Windows:  	       pyinstaller -F --add-data "YSKYSN/*.wav;YSKYSN/" --add-data "YSKYSN/*.mp3;YSKYSN/" YSKYSNsolo.py
	mac/otheros (i think): pyinstaller -F --add-data "YSKYSN/*.wav:YSKYSN/" --add-data "YSKYSN/*.mp3:YSKYSN/" YSKYSNsolo.py

	^ the only difference in these two is ";" vs ":" being used as separators, so idk!!!








----- Playing -----

after all this, a bunch of stuff should pop up, and then at the end, your exe should be in a folder called "dist" in that directory

feel free to put the exe anywhere, and have fun!













ALSO - before you make the exe, make sure you at least look at the py file a bit!! never just make an exe out of someone elses code without checking it a bit.... (and i guess you can see my notes lol)
